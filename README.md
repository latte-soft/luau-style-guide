## What is this?
The Latte Luau Style-Guide is a style-guide created and designed by [Latte Softworks](https://latte.to/) for use with our multiple projects that utilize the [Luau Scripting Language](https://luau-lang.org/), most used with and intended for [Roblox](https://roblox.com/).

## What's the reason for it?
The reason we have created our *own* style-guide is due to the fact that we simply couldn't find another that suited our criteria or needs, at least with Lua/Luau in general. We want to be able to follow a style-guide that fits the language we're using as intented, to prevent any arguments or issues with our projects later on down the line.

This style-guide does follow a lot of the same principles seen in the older and somewhat outdated "[Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide)", but is not a fork or copy. This is a style-guide created from the ground up, designed to suit our own needs with Luau. These principles and rules **can** be easily be used with a language like [vanilla Lua](https://lua.org/) or [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/), however you'll need to be idiomatic with some of the different standards that other languages offer individually.

We very much welcome the Roblox development community (or any other group or individual) to use this style-guide! We are very open to changes, contributions, and general support of this project. We wish to provide a consistent, up-to-date, and easily understandable standard to whoever is looking for one.
