## What is the Latte Luau Style-Guide?
The Latte Luau Style-Guide is a style-guide created and designed by [Latte Softworks](https://latte.to/) for use with our multiple projects that utilize the [Luau Scripting Language](https://luau-lang.org/), most used with and intended for [Roblox](https://roblox.com/).

## What's the reason for this?
The reason we have created our *own* style-guide is due to the fact that we simply couldn't find another that suited our criteria or needs, at least with Lua/Luau in general. We want to be able to follow a style-guide that fits the language we're using as intented, to prevent any arguments or issues with our projects later on down the line.

This style-guide does follow *some* of the principles seen in the older and somewhat outdated "[Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide)", but is not a fork or copy. This is a style-guide created from the ground up, designed to suite our own needs with Luau. These principles/rules **can** be easily be used with [vanilla Lua](https://lua.org/) or [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/).

!!! note

    This style-guide, and it's various principles, can and *may* be modified or manipulated at any point for any number of reasons. We will try our best to not break any major principles, and if that is ever decidied, seperate versions (`V1`, `V2`, etc..) of the style-guide will be maintained.
