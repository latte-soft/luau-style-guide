## What is this?
The Latte Luau Style-Guide is a style-guide created and designed by [Latte Softworks](https://latte.to/) for use with our multiple projects that utilize the [Luau Scripting Language](https://luau-lang.org/), most used with and intended for [Roblox](https://roblox.com/).

## What's the reason for it?
The reason we have created our *own* style-guide is due to the fact that we simply couldn't find another that suited our criteria or needs, at least with Lua/Luau in general. We want to be able to follow a style-guide that fits the language we're using as intented, to prevent any arguments or issues with our projects later on down the line.

This style-guide does follow a lot of the ame principles seen in the older and somewhat outdated "[Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide)", but is not a fork or copy. This is a style-guide created from the ground up, designed to suite our own needs with Luau. These principles/rules **can** be easily be used with [vanilla Lua](https://lua.org/) or [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/).

!!! note

    This style-guide, and it's various principles, can and *may* be modified or manipulated at any point for any number of reasons. We will try our best to not break any major principles, however, if major changes ever need to be made, we will make sure to make large note of them prior.
